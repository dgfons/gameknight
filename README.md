# Game Knight
Let's play a game!

Game Knight is a web app that logs session notes across a D&D campaign. 

The user will create a unique party ID on the 'Create Your Party' page, set the Dungeon Master, players involved in the campaign, and first session notes. Once this party ID exists in the Firebase database, it can be recalled by using the unique ID on the 'View Your Party' page, or have session notes added on the 'Update Your Party' page. 

Game Knight utilizes vanilla Javascript with a Firebase realtime database, with CSS styling.
